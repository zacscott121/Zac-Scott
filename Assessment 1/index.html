									<h2>About Me</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information</h3>
												<p>My name is Zachary (Zac) Scott; I am 21 years old. My birthday is in June; I live in Brisbane and work as a Hire Controller. Some of my interests are app design, computer gaming, fishing, Cooking and Sports, to name a few. I am part Greek, so I love to cook and eat lots of food with my family.</p>
										<h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
									<p>I have always had an interest in IT as it is fun but also mentally challenging. I am interested in learning more amount of server networking as I have watched a couple of my friends' progress through that field. I hope that doing a bachelor's in information technology helps me find a new career in something I am more passionate about and that I can formalise and improve on my skills to find a job suits my interest better. I chose RMIT to do my studies due to the flexibility of being entirely online as a work full-time. </p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h4>
														<p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not in the traditional sense. They are not always out painting happy little trees. They are, however, frequently capable of doing so. Instead, they use aesthetics, design, and even their own choices and actions to challenge social norms. The phrase "Do not box me in!" has probably been uttered more than once by adventurers who enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behaviour.</p>

											<h4>Team Composition</h4>
												<p>Adventurers are the most at ease among their peers. Working with others on a level playing field and offering advice to solve practical problems is exactly where Adventurer personalities thrive. While they may become exhausted if their task needs a lot of social interaction, they are otherwise charming and have excellent networking skills. Usually, adventurers do what needs to be done, regardless of whether their teammates are pulling their weight. However, adventurers are sensitive people who need to know that their efforts are valued. Adventurers seek harmony and, whenever possible, seek out win-win solutions. When forming a team, it is essential to choose the right people to do it with; that way, personalities do not clash. A leader will be needed when for said groups as an adventurer is a follower that silently helps.</p>

												<h4> What's Your Learning Style</h4>
												<p>I am a tactile learner who enjoys taking things apart and putting them back together, and when I am bored, I like to tinker or move around. I have good athletic abilities and am well-coordinated. I can easily recall what was done, but I may have trouble remembering what I saw or heard during the process. Touch is a common way for me to communicate. I appreciate physical expressions of encouragement like a pat on the back. I learn by touching and doing because I am a tactile learner. Physical movement helps me understand and remember things. I am a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what I am learning, and I learn best when I am doing something physical. I need to be active and take frequent breaks; I frequently use my hands and gestures to communicate and find it challenging to sit still.</p>

												<h4>DR. Phil's Personality Test</h4>
												<p>People see me as practical, cautious, and courteous. They think of me as intelligent, gifted but modest. I am not someone who makes friends easily or quickly, but I am incredibly loyal to the friends I do have, and I expect the same loyalty in return. Those who get to know me well realise that it takes a lot to shake my faith in my friends, but it also takes a long time to recover it if that trust is ever broken..</p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
										<h4>Overview</h4>
											<p>The project that I would like to undertake is a mobile application. It will be an app that allows the user to calculate transport costs, check spreadsheets on machinery and have the contact information to speak to a representative if further help is needed. This app would be used for customers to find the equipment they require; they then can look at the cost of the unit they were looking at. They can then calculate the transport pricing to wherever they need it to go. Employees can also use the app to calculate the same information for orders or quotes received over the phone.</p>
										<h4>Motivation</h4>
											<p>With the creation of this mobile application, it will bring ease to a hire controller's job; with this application, they will be able to calculate what the transport charges will be without needing to google the distance and find out machine specs such as weight calculate the cost. This application will streamline the process for customers as they will be able to access all the necessary information in one place from anywhere they would like; there will be no need for multiple phone calls or emails to the hire controllers to get the required information they need to put together a quote.</p>
										<h4>Project Description</h4>
											<p>The mobile application will be an all-in-one quotation/ordering tool that allows customers to search for the information they require while also allowing them to place orders for the equipment they need on-site. The app's first feature would be that customers could access machinery spec sheets and look at the necessary technical data required to use the unit on-site. Using the data obtained for the spec sheets, the customer could then liaise with the site engineer to get approval for the machinery needed on-site as specific machines would be too heavy or too wide for the required environment. The app's second feature would be a transportation calculator that would allow customers to search the suburb they require the machinery to be carted to. This calculator will show the customer the travel distance from our main branch; this will only extend to a 250klm radius; once that distance is exceeded, they will be required to call a hire controller to obtain a transportation quote. It will then show the customer whether toll charges are necessary for the delivery and pick. The customer will then be shown what size truck will be needed to cart the machinery based on the unit’s technical data from the spec sheets. And lastly, the customer will then be shown the total cost of transport to the suburb the customer supplied. The app's third feature would be that we could customise it to each customer by having logins; the customer would then be able to access their rate cards created by their sales representative. The rate card will show the customer the daily, weekly and transport rate on each piece of machinery. The transport charge would be a standard local transport charge; once 45kms is exceeded, the customer will need to use the transport calculator function. The app's fourth feature would be that the customer could place their order through the app instead of ringing the hire controllers to place the order. This feature will be in the form of drop-down boxes and text boxes. The drop-down boxes will allow them to choose the standard information such as date, time, and type of machinery, etcetera; the text boxes will be used for more complex answers such as the delivery address and contact number for the person taking collection of the machinery. Once the order is placed, it will send it through in an email to the hire controllers to process, and it will also send through a confirmation email to the customer. The app's last feature will a contact us page with all contact details linked to the customer's account. There would be a number for the customer to call if there were any issues with the application not working correctly or any malfunctions with the app. This feature will also allow customers to contact hire controllers with any technical questions about anything they did not understand on the spec sheets. They will also be able to contact the sales representative looking after their companies account about any questions to do with their hire rates and negotiate the pricing if required.</p>
										<h4>Tools And Technologies</h4>
											<p>To create the mobile application, I would use software such as openasapp. This software is simple, easy to use and free of charge and contains its own server to store all the data. this software would allow me to design and create the application with the limited knowledge I have in app creation. The use of a computer will be needed for editing and maintaining functionality of the application. I would also require a phone to test the application on to make sure it functions smoothly and the way it is meant to.</p>
										<h4>Skills Required</h4>
											<p>I would use a program called openasapp to start with then move to software that was more complex after I had learnt the necessary skills. This software is simple, easy to use and requires little to no skills to start with to make a simple application. Once I want to start making more complex applications, I will need to learn the software better by watching tutorials online until I understand how to use the more complex app creation elements. The hardware and equipment will be easy to source as most people already have the equipment needed to edit, maintain, run, and test the application.</p>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
											<p>With the completion of this mobile phone application, a hire controller's job will become considerably easier; they will no longer need to take orders over the phone from customers, supply quotes or advise machinery specs. Customers will not need to waste their time calling back and forth to prepare a quote, and they will be able to complete it all on their own. This application's impact will be huge, and it will save hours of phone calls and conversations about the information they can now access all in one place from their mobile phones, from any site at any location.</p>
