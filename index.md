<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Zachary (Zac) Scott; I am 21 years old. My birthday is in June; I live in Brisbane and work as a Hire Controller. Some of my interests are app design, computer gaming, fishing, Cooking and Sports, to name a few. I am part Greek, so I love to cook and eat lots of food with my family.</p>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always had an interest in IT as it is fun but also mentally challenging. I am interested in learning more amount of server networking as I have watched a couple of my friends' progress through that field. I hope that doing a bachelor's in information technology helps me find a new career in something I am more passionate about and that I can formalise and improve on my skills to find a job suits my interest better. I chose RMIT to do my studies due to the flexibility of being entirely online as a work full-time.</p>
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<h2>Network and Systems Administrator</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>System network administrators are responsible for overseeing and supporting the day-to-day operation of computer systems and networks across an organisation, ensuring reliable performance and data integrity in local area networks, wide area networks, and intranets.

<p>The system network administrator's responsibilities are primarily server-side maintenance and deployment tasks. However, they can also include direct user support, especially during upgrades and migrations. The system network administrator must balance technical skills with a broad understanding of how their data infrastructure is used.</p>

<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
<p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not in the traditional sense. They are not always out painting happy little trees. They are, however, frequently capable of doing so. Instead, they use aesthetics, design, and even their own choices and actions to challenge social norms. The phrase "Do not box me in!" has probably been uttered more than once by adventurers who enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behaviour.</p>

<h3>Team Composition</h3>
<p>Adventurers are the most at ease among their peers. Working with others on a level playing field and offering advice to solve practical problems is exactly where Adventurer personalities thrive. While they may become exhausted if their task needs a lot of social interaction, they are otherwise charming and have excellent networking skills. Usually, adventurers do what needs to be done, regardless of whether their teammates are pulling their weight. However, adventurers are sensitive people who need to know that their efforts are valued. Adventurers seek harmony and, whenever possible, seek out win-win solutions. When forming a team, it is important to choose the right people to do it with; that way, personalities do not clash. A leader will be needed when for said groups as an adventurer is a follower that silently helps.</p>
<h2>Test Two</h2>
<h3>What's Your Learning Style</h3>
<p>I am a tactile learner who enjoys taking things apart and putting them back together, and when I am bored, I like to tinker or move around. I have good athletic abilities and am well-coordinated. I can easily recall what was done, but I may have trouble remembering what I saw or heard during the process. Touch is a common way for me to communicate. I appreciate physical expressions of encouragement like a pat on the back. I learn by touching and doing because I am a tactile learner. Physical movement helps me understand and remember things. I am a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what I am learning, and I learn best when I am doing something physical. I need to be active and take frequent breaks; I frequently use my hands and gestures to communicate and find it challenging to sit still.</p>
<h2>Test Three</h2>
<h3>Dr Phil's Personality Test (PsychCentral)</h3>
<p>People see me as practical, cautious, and cautious. They think of me as intelligent, gifted, or gifted but modest. I am not someone who makes friends easily or quickly, but I am incredibly loyal to the friends I do have, and I expect the same loyalty in return. Those who get to know me well realise that it takes a lot to shake my faith in my friends, but it also takes a long time to recover it if that trust is ever broken.</p>
<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The project that I would like to make will be a phone app. It will be an app that allows the user to calculate transport costs, check spreadsheets on machinery and have the contact information to speak to a representative. This app would be used for customers to find the equipment they require; they then can look at the costing of that unit and calculate the transport pricing.</p>
